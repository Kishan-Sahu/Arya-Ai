### Step 2 Perform simple preprocessing
### Step 3 Train rough m,odel using Logistic regression with 90 % accuracy
### Step 4 Perform EDA mainly correlation map and extract the insights.
### Steps 5 Use that insight to drop some features
### Steps 6 Perform Scaling and now model is performing well with 93 %accuracy
### Steps 7 Use PCA for further feature Selection but it decrease the model performance
### Step 8 Make predictions on test set given
